1. Grant of License
You (the “Licensee”) are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the portfolio template in one (1) commercial project / website. The license permits use for client work, freelance projects, and business websites.

2. Permitted Uses
- Use, modify, and deploy the template on a single live domain (one published project).
- Deliver a site built from the template to a client, provided the client does not receive the original source files as a transferable package.

3. Additional Commercial Options
- **Multi-Site License**: Purchase additional site licenses to deploy on multiple domains.
- **Extended License**: Contact the author for a commercial extended license that permits redistribution, SaaS use, or resale of derivative templates.

4. Prohibited Uses
- You MAY NOT resell, rebrand, redistribute, or share the original template files as a standalone product.
- You MAY NOT upload the original template (or slightly modified versions) to marketplaces or code repositories for sale or free distribution.
- You MAY NOT claim authorship of the original design.

5. Attribution
Attribution is optional but appreciated. If the template includes third-party assets (icons, fonts, images), you must obey those assets' license terms (some assets may require attribution or separate licenses).

6. Support & Updates
Commercial purchases include:
- 30 days of email support for installation/bug fixes.
- Minor updates within 90 days of purchase.
Extended support or custom work available for an additional fee.

7. Warranty & Liability
The template is provided "as is." Minimal warranty: the author will fix confirmed template bugs for licensed users within the support period. The author is not liable for indirect or consequential damages.

8. Refunds
Refund policy: specify your refund terms (e.g., no refunds after download). For direct sales, consider a 48-hour refund window before providing files.

9. Termination
Violation of the license voids the license and requires deletion of the template files. The author reserves the right to terminate license for misuse.
